liblouis 3.35.0 has been released

The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.35.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release brings quite a few technical improvements. We've enhanced
support for memory management in the API, added support for math
characters in ``match`` rules, expanded the Python bindings to include
metadata API support, and made it possible to set the log level via the
``LOUIS_LOGLEVEL`` environment variable.

There are also substantial updates to various language tables, including
improvements to Portuguese 8-dot braille, Hebrew back-translation,
Norwegian 8-dot support, UEB forward translation, and Hungarian braille.
We've added support for Rokuten Kanji (Japanese Kanji Braille). Russian,
Ukrainian, and Belarusian literary braille tables have received updates
to their space handling rules, and the Danish tables have seen fixes
related to typos and hyphenation.

I'd like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

New features
------------

-  ``match`` rules now also support testing for math characters. Thanks
   to James Bowden for the idea and Bert Frees for the implementation.
-  Add Support for "Rokuten Kanji", the other Japanese system for Kanji
   Braille.
-  The API now contains functions to free memory that was returned by
   API calls. See the documentation for details. Thanks to Leonard de
   Ruijter.
-  The Python bindings now support most of the metadata API, thanks to
   Leonard de Ruijter.

Bug fixes
---------

-  ``ucBrl`` in the mode parameter now correctly works also for
   back-translation. Thanks to Bert Frees.
-  Fix a segfault when a StringBuffer is used before it is initialized.
   Thanks to Anthony Tibbs.
-  Fix a bug in the handling of ``nocont`` in conjunction with
   ``seqdelimiter``. Thanks to Bert Frees.

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  Improvements to the Portuguese 8-dot Braille table: Correct angle
   quotation mark characters used in Portugal, add missing symbols, such
   as Greek alphabet and double quotation mark characters used in
   Brazil. Also added symbols that aren't defined in the Portuguese
   standard but are commonly found in texts and web pages, such as
   bullet points, some common mathematical symbols, etc. Thanks to Tiago
   M. Casal.
-  Fix the back-translation of the Greek Sigma and other small
   improvements to the Hebrew table. Thanks to Leonard de Ruijter.
-  Improvements to Norwegian 8dot thanks to Lars Bjørndal.

   -  Add more characters and math symbols.
   -  Fix a back-translation problem when two dot 6 are followed by a
      word.
   -  Fix a problem where the letter "i" is followed by number.

-  Improvements to UEB forward translation, in particular fixes for
   rarer words and some proper names. Thanks to James Bowden.
-  Hungarian improvements thanks to Attila Hammer.
-  Fix typos and hyphenations in the Danish tables thanks to Bue
   Vester-Andersen.
-  Improvements to the back translation for the Russian literary Braille
   table: Now, if a space is intentionally input after a comma or
   semicolon, a double space will not occur. If no space was input, a
   space will still be automatically added, as before. This change also
   applies to Ukrainian and Belarusian literary Braille tables. Thanks
   to Andrey Yakuboy.

Other changes
-------------

-  Hans Anton Ålien proof read the documentation and fixed quite a few
   typos.
-  The log level of the library can now also be set via the
   ``LOUIS_LOGLEVEL`` environment variable.
